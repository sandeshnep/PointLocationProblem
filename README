In this project, I created a Binary Search Tree to solve the Point Location Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_location. 

The aim of this project is to us data structures to solve real mathematical problems. 


Build Instructions:
Go to the src folder and open the terminal on that 
directory. 

Then, enter the following on the command line:
javac Test.java

followed by:
java Test


This project was quite challenging and it really exercised my problem-solving and analytical skills. Please read the OUTPUT.txt for the steps to run the program.
Here is how the program works. I used a Point array to store the points for each line. Using these, a binary tree was created with the help of the ccw function.
If the lines intersect, I split one of the lines into two line segments and proceeded to the corresponding pathway from there. 
Once the Tree worked, I used the ccw function yet again to search for the point. I stored the pathway in an array and then compared the arrays to find where the points
deviate into different region. 
The Pathways for each points are printed in the console, as is everything else. 

Please note that I have made the GUI for extra credits.

Here is the list of all files:
