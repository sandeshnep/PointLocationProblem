HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1) Insert arbitrary lines on the Main Method of Test.java. 
	The lines should be in the following format:
	lines.add(new Point[] {Point0, Point1}); where Point0 and Point1 are the end points of the line
	NOTE: The points will not work if they are decimals. Since Points only take integer values, please multiply each decimal point by 100. My program works with values ranging from 0 to 100. For example, you would input (0.00, 0.12) as (0, 12).
	Additionally, the Lines in the Project description are already added by default in the Main Method;
	The first line you add will be Line 0, the second will be Line 1, third will be Line 2, etc...
2) Run the Test class. 
3) Click at a point in the Frame.  This will be Point a.
4) Click again at a point in the Frame. This will be Point b. 
5) Look at the console, it will print out the Paths to the points, whether they are in the same region, or if they are separated by a line or not. 
6) Click as many times as you please, and look at the results in the console. Points a and b will be reset each time. 
7) Please let me know if you have any questions.


//OUTPUT:
	In order traversal of the tree : 
	31403241424
	Number of external Nodes = 12
	Path Point a : Line 0-> right -> Line 1-> right -> Line 2-> left -> Line 4-> left -> 
	Path Point b : Line 0-> right -> Line 1-> right -> Line 2-> right -> Line 4-> right -> 
	The Points are NOT in the same region.
	The Points are saperated by Line 2
